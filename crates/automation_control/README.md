# `automation_control`

`automation_control` provides the protocol and Bevy integration used by isolated Controlled
Sessions. A Player Run does not depend on this crate. The crate does not know Star-Sim menu
semantics and never injects operating-system input.

## Protocol v2

The session emits one `ready` message. The host assigns request sequences beginning at `1`.
Controllers send only commands and do not provide protocol versions or request IDs.

```json
{"type":"ready","version":2,"mode":"rendered","controls":["pointer","keyboard","text","time","screenshot"],"observation_scopes":["targets","ui","pointers","entity","virtual_input","clock"]}
```

```json
{"sequence":1,"command":{"type":"observe","selector":{"type":"ui"},"projection":{"type":"summary"},"limit":64}}
```

```json
{"sequence":2,"command":{"type":"pointer","action":{"type":"move","surface":null,"position":[320.0,180.0]}}}
```

```json
{"sequence":3,"command":{"type":"keyboard","action":{"type":"press","key":"a"}}}
{"sequence":4,"command":{"type":"keyboard","action":{"type":"release","key":"a"}}}
{"sequence":5,"command":{"type":"text","text":"controlled text"}}
{"sequence":6,"command":{"type":"time","action":{"type":"advance","frames":1,"step_nanoseconds":16666667}}}
{"sequence":7,"command":{"type":"screenshot","path":"captures/after-step.png"}}
```

The public command groups are `Observe`, `Pointer`, `Keyboard`, `Text`, `Time`, `Screenshot`, and `Shutdown`. Pointer
actions are `Move`, `Press`, `Release`, and `Scroll`; there is no wire-level click. Keyboard press
and release are separate requests. `keyboard::Key` defines the stable wire names for letters,
digits, punctuation, modifiers, navigation keys, and F1 through F12. Text commands accept at most
16 KiB of UTF-8 and commit the whole string to the focused Bevy `EditableText`. A missing,
stale, or non-editable focus returns `text_focus_unavailable`.

`time.advance` runs between 1 and 10,000 complete application frames. `step_nanoseconds` must be an
integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000. Invalid frame counts and steps return
`invalid_time_frames`, `time_frames_too_large`, `invalid_time_step`, or `time_step_too_large`
without changing the clock. Controlled Sessions do not run Bevy simulation schedules while no
advance command is pending. Input commands update session-local Virtual Input immediately, while
Bevy application systems consume the queued transitions on the next controlled frame.

A rendered composition opts into screenshots with `automation_control::screenshot::Plugin`. The
plugin does not install a renderer, and `ready.controls` includes `screenshot` only when the
composition already has Bevy's renderer and screenshot capture. Logical Mode and renderer-free
compositions return `screenshot_capability_unavailable`.

`ready` is a control-plane signal. It reports that the protocol accepts commands and that the
advertised services exist. It does not mean that Bevy has completed UI layout, render extraction,
or its first presented frame. Controllers that need an image must advance separate controlled
frames and wait for an application-specific visible condition, such as an expected tile color.
Sending several frames in one `time.advance` request advances simulation schedules in one outer
application update, so it is not a substitute for separate updates while the first rendered scene
is being prepared.

Screenshot paths must be normalized, relative `.png` paths beneath the host-provided session
artifact root. Absolute paths, `.` or `..` components, and symbolic links are rejected. A completed
response contains the artifact type, session-relative path, MIME type, width, and height. The
response is written only after GPU readback, PNG encoding, and a successful read-back check. Fixed
scene dimensions and semantic image content are testable. Identical PNG bytes across operating
systems and GPUs are not guaranteed.

## Embed the plugin

```rust
use automation_control::AutomationControlPlugin;

app.add_plugins(AutomationControlPlugin::logical_stdio());
// A rendered composition uses `rendered_stdio()` instead.
```

Tests and embedding applications provide the protocol mode and transport adapters explicitly:

```rust
use automation_control::RunMode;

app.add_plugins(AutomationControlPlugin::with_io(
    RunMode::Rendered,
    input,
    output,
));
```

`RunMode` is protocol metadata. It does not select an application composition or install or remove a
renderer; the embedding application remains responsible for composing the matching session.

The rendered `bevy_test_apps` composition disables `InputPlugin` and `GilrsPlugin`. The control
plugin also disables Bevy's native mouse and touch picking producers, writes `PointerInput` into
Bevy's picking pipeline, and clears the OS cursor stored on Bevy windows. Because UI, focus, and
picking systems still require low-level Bevy input message channels and state resources when
`InputPlugin` is absent, the plugin registers them empty as
compatibility prerequisites. Registration neither creates native input producers nor opens an OS
input connection; the composition's native producers remain disabled. The plugin clears native
window, keyboard, focus, mouse, touch, scroll, gamepad, and IME message buffers before focused-input
dispatch.

Virtual keyboard commands write `KeyboardInput`, update Bevy's `ButtonInput<KeyCode>` and
`ButtonInput<Key>` resources, and use Bevy's focused-input dispatch. Virtual text commands write
`Ime::Commit`, which `EditableTextInputPlugin` routes to the focused `EditableText`. The plugin
processes one request per event-loop update. Input responses acknowledge the queued session-local
transition. An advance response is written only after every requested frame, including application
observers and text-edit systems, has completed. `stdout` contains JSONL only. Diagnostics use
`stderr`.

## Observation

`observation::observe_world` computes each answer from the current World. Selectors cover target
markers, UI entities, pointer entities, and one entity handle. Projections include summaries,
component names, selected reflected component values, and bounded hierarchies. Results are sorted
by session-local `{index,generation}` handles and paged with a hard limit and stateless cursor.
Reflection is read-only. Components that are absent, unregistered, not reflectable, not serializable,
or too large receive an explicit status.

The `clock` selector with the `summary` projection reports the completed frame index, elapsed
controlled nanoseconds, and the last step in nanoseconds. Repeated observations do not change it.

```json
{"sequence":7,"command":{"type":"observe","selector":{"type":"clock"},"projection":{"type":"summary"},"limit":1}}
```

The `virtual_input` selector with the `summary` projection reports the session's pointer position,
pressed pointer buttons, last scroll delta, held keyboard keys, current Bevy input focus, and last
text commit. These resources belong to one Controlled Session and are never shared with another
session.

```json
{"sequence":8,"command":{"type":"observe","selector":{"type":"virtual_input"},"projection":{"type":"summary"},"limit":1}}
```

`AutomationTarget` is an empty marker. It has no persistent semantic ID, role, label, or action
list. Handles are valid only for the current Bevy World.

## Debug Host

Enable the optional Debug Host support for a host application. The former `driver` feature and
`automation_control::driver` module remain aliases for compatibility.

```toml
automation_control = { path = "../../crates/automation_control", features = ["host"] }
```

```rust
let mut session = Session::spawn(&launch, SessionOptions::new())?;
let ready = session.ready()?;
session.request(Command::Shutdown)?;
session.shutdown()?;
```

`host::Session` owns protocol and recording sequences, child-process lifecycle, JSON serialization,
response matching and stderr streaming. `LaunchSpec` can start Cargo binaries or examples.
Diagnostics and report helpers remain available to host tools. `host::run_embedded` adds the generic
REPL, Session Script, Session Replay, and artifact-report workflows from a validated TOML profile.
Application-specific launch and observation details belong in that embedded profile rather than in
the host implementation.

## Session Recording

Enable recording at launch with an artifact-root-relative path:

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;
use automation_control::driver::{SessionOptions, recording::Controller};

let options = SessionOptions::new()
    .with_artifact_dir("artifacts/session")
    .with_record(Some(PathBuf::from("recordings/run.jsonl")))
    .with_recording_context(
        "alpha",
        automation_control::RunMode::Logical,
        serde_json::json!({"surface": [640, 360]}),
    )
    .with_controller(Controller::new("repl"));
```

`with_recording_context` lets a host include its complete configuration and checks its mode against
`ready`. Without explicit context, the driver waits for `ready` and fills the mode and protocol before
writing `SessionStarted`. `Session::start_recording(None)` allocates a collision-free path below the
artifact root. `Session::stop_recording()` flushes and closes the current segment. Starting another segment keeps
the same strictly increasing host sequence and writes the complete open-session context first.
Requested paths must be relative `.jsonl` paths without `.` or `..` components, and existing files
or symbolic-link escapes are rejected.

The JSONL format has its own `driver::recording::FORMAT_VERSION`. Every line contains `version`,
`sequence`, and a typed event. Events distinguish session context, source-neutral Controller
actions with Controller-origin metadata, game responses, observations, errors, artifact references,
recording stops, and session completion or abort. The recorder never copies child stderr. It redacts
sensitive fields and messages and bounds strings, collections, nesting, and serialized entry size so
credentials and raw model prompts cannot enter the file. `recording::Recording::parse_reader` and
`parse_path` validate the version and strictly increasing
sequences, returning an unsupported-version error for newer formats.

Host waits compose existing observation and time commands. They do not add a wait command to the wire protocol. `FrameLimit` validates both the maximum frame count and each controlled time step against the protocol limits:

```rust
use automation_control::driver::wait::FrameLimit;

let response = session.wait_for_observation(
    observation,
    FrameLimit::new(120, 16_666_667)?,
    |result| result["items"].as_array().is_some_and(|items| !items.is_empty()),
)?;
```

The predicate sees the current observation before any frame advances. After each miss, the driver advances one frame and observes again. Exhaustion returns `DriverError::WaitLimitReached` with the last observation.

## Bevy application smoke tests

The display-free `logical_state` binary runs in Logical Mode with a fixed data-only surface. It exercises Virtual Pointer and Keyboard input, controlled timers, `Update`, `FixedUpdate`, reflected state, deterministic observations, bounded host waits, and typed screenshot rejection through a real child process:

```bash
cargo test -p automation_control --features driver --test logical_state -- --test-threads=1
```

The `bevy_test_apps` package also contains the rendered `context_menu` binary. Without features it runs as a Player
Run. With `automation`, it disables `InputPlugin` and the native gamepad producer, enables the
Controlled Session plugin, marks the background, buttons, menu items, and editable text target, and
exposes reflected pointer, keyboard, and text state. Package structure, run commands, target naming,
reflection conventions, and the adapted Bevy example's provenance are documented in
[`bevy_test_apps/README.md`](bevy_test_apps/README.md).

```bash
cargo run -p automation_control --example bevy_controller --features driver
```

The default smoke exits as soon as its assertions pass. To keep the Controlled Session open while
moving the virtual pointer in one circle per second, provide a duration:

```bash
cargo run -p automation_control --example bevy_controller --features driver -- --circle-seconds 60
```

A display and render adapter are required for that smoke test. Display-free protocol, observation,
and driver tests do not need them.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test -p automation_control
cargo test -p automation_control --features driver
```

The rendered readiness stress test launches fresh `ui_drag_drop` sessions and distinguishes black
textures, Bevy's clear-only frame, and screenshots containing scene content. Build the controlled
binary once so repeated launches do not include Cargo startup time:

```bash
cargo build -p bevy_test_apps --bin ui_drag_drop --features automation
RENDER_STRESS_APP=target/debug/ui_drag_drop \
  cargo run -p automation_control --example render_readiness_stress --features driver
```

Use `RENDER_STRESS_RUNS`, `RENDER_STRESS_FRAMES`, `RENDER_STRESS_ATTEMPTS`, and
`RENDER_STRESS_DELAY_MS` to change the run. `RENDER_STRESS_CAPTURE_READY=true` also records the
frame available immediately after `ready`.

Replay, camera operations, screenshot comparison, video capture, persistent semantic IDs, and
model adapters are follow-up work outside this slice.
